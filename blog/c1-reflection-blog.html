  <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
  <p>
    It's very inspiring and I fully support the way that EDA is approching to create developers not just by learning technology but also how to work in a team,
    being a part of that team and as they as "if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together".
  </p>
  <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
  <p>
    I like what Shereef said about what makes EDA different from the formal education. When we go to schools/univerites, we go there expacting it as a package. We might like it,
    we might even be forced to do it and hate it. At EDA, you are here because you want to be here. You want to find something your're passionate about and you want to be in
    an environment where you have a support of people like you. Enjoy what you learn and don't get frustrated because everyone can learn new things.
  </p>
  <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
  <p>
    This was one of the reasons why I was very excited. Not to just to impove my technical skills, but also because of the culture. I couldn't wait to start when I enrolled few weeks
    ago and now I'm very ready to go all the way and enjoy it to the full extent.
  </p>
  <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
  <p>
    No, not at all. In fact, it made me even more excited and I'm looking forward to work on more challenges and figure things out.
  </p>
  <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm very excited to be in this environment. I might be a little nervous but that's okay, I want to lean to impove myself and when I start my first job I won't be
    as nervous as I might be.
