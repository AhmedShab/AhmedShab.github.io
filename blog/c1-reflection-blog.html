      <h2>My reflaction on the EDA experience</h2>
      <p>
        After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I was very inspired. It's very inspiring and I fully support the way that EDA is approching to create developers not just by learning technology, but also how to work in a team,
        being a part of that team and as they as "if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together".
      </p>
      <p>
        I like what Shereef said about what makes EDA different from the formal education. When we go to schools/univerites, we go there expecting it as a package. We might like it,
        we might even be forced to do it and hate it. At EDA, you are here because you want to be here. You want to find something your're passionate about and you want to be in
        an environment where you have a support of people like yourself. Enjoy what you learn and don't get frustrated because everyone can learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engaging to this type culture is what made me excited. Not to just to impove my technical skills, but also because of the culture. I couldn't wait to start when I enrolled few weeks
        ago and now I'm very ready to go all the way and enjoy it to the full extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expectations haven't changed at all. In fact, it made me even more excited and I'm looking forward to work on more challenges and figure things out with my team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm very excited to be in this environment. I might be a little nervous but that's okay, I want to lean to impove myself and when I start working I won't be
        as nervous as I might be.
