<h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
<p>
  While reading the articles I set myslef a time to go through them. Even when I wasn't quite done, I moved on to work on another task.
</p>
<h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>
<p>
  I really liked the Fogg Method and would be very interested to try it out myself starting from tomorrow.
</p>
<h2>what worked for you?</h2>
<p>
  I haven't tried any of them yet but would really want to start the Fogg method soon and apply it to my everyday life.
</p>
<h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
<p>
  They two I want to apply to my everday life are creating habits and fixed Mindset. I like the what said about you have to show your behavoir first
  then the attitude will follow ("Display your ability first. Prove it to yourself and then youâ€™ll believe it.").
