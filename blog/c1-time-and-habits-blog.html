<h2>Timebox and habits techniques</h2>
<p>
  While reading the articles I set myslef a time to go through them. Even when I wasn't quite done, I moved on to work on another task.
</p>
<p>
  I really liked the Fogg Method and would be very interested to try it out myself starting from tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't tried any of them yet but would really want to start the Fogg method soon and apply it to my everyday life.
</p>
<p>
  There are two techniques I want to apply to my everday life, creating habits and fixed Mindset. I like what Charles Duhigg said about you have to show your behavoir first
  then the attitude will follow ("Display your ability first. Prove it to yourself and then youâ€™ll believe it.").
