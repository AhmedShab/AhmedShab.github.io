              <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
              <p>
                Chapter 5's title is "Riding Your Emotion like a Horse",
                that to me means we have to try to control our emotions rather than it controls us.<br/><br/>
              </p>
              <p>
                There a lot of good parts to take from this chapter, one of them is the four general principles for dealing with distress.<br/><br/>
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>1. Know when you are not in pain.</b><br/><br/>
                <b>2. Do not feel bad about feeling bad.</b><br/><br/>
                <b>3. Do not feed the monster.</b><br/><br/>
                <b>4. Start every thought with kindness and humor.</b><br/><br/>
              </p>
              <p>
                I have to also mention the "Siberian North Railroad" method for dealing with triggers. That is doing these five steps:<br/><br/>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>1. Stop </b><br/><br/>
                <b>2. Breathe</b><br/><br/>
                <b>3. Notice</b><br/><br/>
                <b>5. Respond</b><br/><br/>
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, we have to do our best by not letting our emotion getting in our way.
                If we can control our emotions, we can achieve amazing things in our life.
